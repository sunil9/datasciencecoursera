corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
    # Calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where 
    # the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold.
    # Args:
    #   directory: character vector of length 1 indicating
    #              the location of the CSV files
    #   threshold: numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
    #              number of completely observed observations (on all variables) 
    #              required to compute the correlation between nitrate and sulfate; 
    #              the default is 0
    # Returns:
    # Numeric vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
    # If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, the function returns a numeric vector of length 0
